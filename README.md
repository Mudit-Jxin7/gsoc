# GSOC Organization Tracker

Welcome to the GSOC Organization Tracker project! This project is built using Next.js and TypeScript, and leverages the Google Summer of Code (GSOC) API to allow users to search, filter, and view information about organizations that have participated in GSOC. Users can filter organizations by year, topics, and technologies, and can also see data and projects from previous years.
